# Minerva
Developed by the BrainWave team, Minerva is an iOS app that uses artificial intelligence to help digital illustrators in their creative process. After a research, we found that many illustrators struggle with lack of inspiration at some point of their professional life and use AI to get suggestions, but are sometimes afraid of the technology or not sure on how to use the many tools available on the web. Minerva simplifies the process and allows artists to access generative AI tools in a more direct way.

Let the Roman goddess of wisdom and arts Minerva inspire your works!

## Setup
To use the app, you should build it on an iPad via XCode.

## Technologies
- SwiftUI
- OpenAI API
- OpenAI Swift package
- Core Data

## Features
- Generate images through text prompt to get an idea of how your subject could be depicted.
- Upload one of your creations directly from your camera roll and generate variations of it to get suggestions on how you could change it or do it differently.
- Go through the entire history of your generated images, since the same image can never be generated more than once!
- Store and arrange your favourite generated images in customizable folders.
- Internalizations: the app is translated in Italian, English and Portuguese.
